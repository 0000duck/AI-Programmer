Note: Notice the AI took advantage of a buffer underflow exception by decrementing the memory pointer to -1, forcing an exception in the interpreter and ending the program (optimally early). After the first print statement with the correct answer, the next loop iteration decrements the memory pointer, causing the exception. This is technically correct, since the AI is not penalized for exceptions.
